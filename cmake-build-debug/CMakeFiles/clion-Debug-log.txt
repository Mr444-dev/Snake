CMake Deprecation Warning at cmake-build-debug/_deps/sfml-src/CMakeLists.txt:5 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.10 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value.  Or, use the <min>...<max> syntax
  to tell CMake that the project requires at least <min> but has been updated
  to work with policies introduced by <max> or earlier.


CMake Warning (dev) at D:/JetBrains Programs/CLion/bin/cmake/win/x64/share/cmake-3.31/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:441 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (VORBIS)
  does not match the name of the calling package (Vorbis).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  cmake-build-debug/_deps/sfml-src/cmake/Modules/FindVorbis.cmake:25 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
